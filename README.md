# Product-Recommendation-System
It's a machine learning-based project that uses techniques like collaborative and content-based filtering to provide personalized product suggestions. It's also helpful to list the key technologies used, such as Python and relevant data science libraries.
Product Recommendation System
This repository contains the code for a machine learning-based product recommendation system designed to provide personalized and trending product suggestions for an e-commerce platform. The system is built using Flask for the backend and a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend.

âœ¨ Features
User-friendly Interface: A web application with a modern and clean design for easy navigation and product browsing.

Trending Products: The homepage displays a dynamic list of trending products, helping users discover popular items.

Personalized Recommendations: Users can receive product recommendations based on their interactions, powered by machine learning algorithms.

Data-Driven: The system leverages a comprehensive dataset of product information, including categories, brands, names, descriptions, and user reviews.

Secure Authentication: User sign-up and sign-in functionality is implemented using Flask-SQLAlchemy and a MySQL database for secure user management.

Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: A Jupyter Notebook (recommendations code.ipynb) is included to show the data cleaning and preprocessing steps, including handling missing values and creating a clean dataset (clean_data.csv).

Visual Enhancements: The interface includes images for trending products and a background video on the landing page to create a rich user experience.

ðŸš€ Getting Started
Follow these steps to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

Prerequisites
Python 3.x

Git

Installation
Clone the repository:

Bash

git clone <your-repository-url>
cd ecommerce
Set up a virtual environment
It's recommended to create a Python virtual environment to manage project dependencies.

Bash

python -m venv venv
On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

On macOS/Linux: source venv/bin/activate

Install dependencies
You will need to install the necessary Python libraries. A requirements.txt file is required. Create it by running:

Bash

pip freeze > requirements.txt
Then install the packages:

Bash

pip install -r requirements.txt
Database Setup
The project uses a MySQL database. Ensure you have MySQL installed and running. Update the database configuration in app.py with your credentials:
app.config['SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI'] = "mysql://root:@localhost/ecom"

Run the application
Start the Flask development server by running:

Bash

python app.py
The application will be accessible at http://127.0.0.1:5000 in your web browser.
